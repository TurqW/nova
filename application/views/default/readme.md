# Pulsar skin

## Changing the header logo

If you want to change the logo used in the header of the skin or at the top of the login page, you can simply drop an image named `logo` into the `dist/images` folder in the skin. The skin will see the image and use that instead of the Nova logo. Supported file formats for replacing the header logo are PNG, SVG, or JPG.
